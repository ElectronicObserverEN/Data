This repository contains translations for most game related data such as ships, equipment, quests etc.

If you want to add a new language you just need to make a new folder [here](https://github.com/ElectronicObserverEN/Data/tree/master/Translations), the folder name being the [culture code](https://www.venea.net/web/culture_code).
[ElectronicObserver](https://github.com/ElectronicObserverEN/ElectronicObserver) also needs to add support for loading the new language files. Translations unrelated to game data need to be added via resx files in that repository.
